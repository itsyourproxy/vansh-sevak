<p>Friendship is a **special bond** between two or more people that is based on mutual trust, respect, and care. It is a **relationship** that is built over time and is characterized by **shared experiences, interests, and values**. Friends are there to support each other through the ups and downs of life, to offer a listening ear, and to provide a shoulder to cry on when needed. They are also there to celebrate each other's successes and to share in each other's joys. A true friend is someone who accepts you for who you are, flaws</p>
